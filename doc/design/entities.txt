ORE/Open Rating Environment.

Database model and data entities.


1. Database model concepts

The database model for ORE will have to deal with the following kinds of data:

- User/Customer Accounts and related Subscriptions.

- Product/Service/Package/Catalog definitions.

- Parameter Definitions and Values.

- Event Types and Rated Event Records.

- Invoices.

- Business procedures:

  - Event guidance procedures.

  - Event rating procedures.

  - Subscription modifier procedures.

  - Billing modifier procedures.


2.1. User/Customer Accounts

An Account will be the entity to represent a single customer or user in the
service platform. Actually it represents a single billable entity, although it
is not a monetary-only concept, since it could refer to several currencies at
the same time, and will usually contain associated contact data.

That said, a single account will typically contain data for the following
kinds of informations:

- Default, secondary currencies.

- Currency balances.

- Billing period and date information.

- Account status (active/blocked/deleted...).

- Commercial model information determining the Products available for the
  Account.

- Contact data, like:

  - Personal data (Name, surname...).

  - Address.

  - Phone number(s).

  - E-mail address(es).

- Additional parameter values as needed for the specific deployment.

Each independent field or parameter value may be optional depending on
specific deployment needs.


2.2. Product, Service, Package and Catalog information

A Service is the definition of a kind of service that may be provided to a
customer or user.

A Service definition may define specific Parameters that determine specific
characteristics of the Service. For instance, for a basic phone Service, the
phone number for the subscriber line would be a Parameter to be defined.

Services may be subclassed. Each Service may be a root Service, so that it has
no parent Service, or may inherit from exactly one parent Service. When a
Service inherits from a parent Service, it inherits all the Parameter defined
for its parent, as well as any Parameter inherited by its parent Service.

Each root Service defines an Event Type (a definition for the data that
defines each Service usage) that is inherited and cannot be modified by child
Services.

Each Service may assign Values for the Parameters that itself defines, or for
any Parameter inherited from it's parent Service, if any. If a Service doesn't
define a Value for a Parameter, it inherits the any Value that may be defined
or inherited by its parent Service, if any.
