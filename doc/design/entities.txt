Database model concepts

The database model for ORE will have to deal with the 
following kinds of data:

* User/Customer Accounts and related Subscriptions.

* Product/Service/Catalog definitions.

* Parameter Definitions and Values.

* Event Types and Rated Event Records.

* Invoices.

* Business procedures:

  * Event Guidance Procedures.

  * Event Rating Procedures.

  * Subscription Modifier Procedures.

  * Billing Modifier Procedures.

1.1 User and Customer Accounts



An Account will be the entity to represent a single 
customer or user in the service platform. Actually it 
represents a single billable entity, although it is not 
a monetary-only concept, since it could refer to 
several currencies at the same time, and will usually 
contain associated contact data.

That said, a single account will typically contain data 
for the following kinds of informations:

* Default, secondary currencies.

* Currency balances.

* Billing period and date information.

* Account status (active/blocked/deleted...).

* Commercial model information determining the Products 
  available for the Account, including the Catalog 
  assigned to a given Account.

* Contact data, like:

* Personal data (Name, surname...).

* Address.

* Phone number(s).

* E-mail address(es).

* Additional parameter values as needed for the 
  specific deployment.

* Product and associated Service Subscriptions, 
  representing each service that the Account has 
  subscribed to with the operator.

Each independent field or parameter value may be 
optional depending on specific deployment needs, and 
may be assigned a default value for the whole platform.

Each Account may have a parent Account. In that case, 
the child Account inherits every parameter value 
defined in the parent Account, except for the ones 
overridden or redefined at the child Account level. See 
figure [cap:Account-inheritance.] for an example of Account inheritance.

1.2 Product, Service and Catalog information

Services, Products and Catalogs model the services that 
a company offers to their customers and the way in 
which they are sold.

1.2.1 Services



A Service is the definition of a kind of service that 
may be provided to a customer or user.

A Service definition may define specific Parameters 
that determine specific characteristics of the Service. 
For instance, for a basic phone Service, the phone 
number for the subscriber line would be a Parameter to 
be defined.

Services may be subclassed. Each Service may be a root 
Service, so that it has no parent Service, or may 
inherit from exactly one parent Service. When a Service 
inherits from a parent Service, it inherits all the 
Parameter defined for its parent, as well as any 
Parameter inherited by its parent Service.

Each root Service defines an Event Type (a definition 
for the data that defines each Service usage) that is 
inherited and cannot be modified by child Services.

In the same fashion, each root Service defines an event 
guidance procedure that will be used in order to find 
to which Account and Service Subscription every 
incoming event of the matching Event Type will be 
routed to.

Each Service may assign Values for the Parameters that 
itself defines, or for any Parameter inherited from its 
parent Service, if any. If a Service doesn't define a 
Value for a Parameter, it inherits any Value that may 
be defined or inherited by its parent Service, if any.

1.2.2 Products

Products are combinations of Services that may be sold 
as a unit to a customer. Services themselves may not be 
sold. Each Product will group one or more Services that 
will be sold together under a commercial name.

Products may define Parameters and give Values to them 
too, in the same way as Services do.

Products may subclass other products. In this case 
Parameter and Value inheritance applies in the same way 
as it does for Services. Additionally, each Product 
that subclasses another Product inherits it's parent 
Services, and may add new Services to the group of 
Services inherited. However, a child Product definition 
cannot remove any one of the Services inherited from 
its parent Product.

1.2.3 Catalogs

A Catalog is a group of Products that are available to 
a given class of customers. In each one of these 
groups, each individual Product may be mandatory or 
optional. Mandatory Products are automatically 
subscribed whenever an Account is assigned the 
containing Catalog. Optional Products may be subscribed 
or terminated by the customer afterwards in any free 
combination. 

1.3 Parameter Definitions and Values

Most of the actual information in ORE related to 
customers, services and subscriptions is stored in the 
Values of Parameters defined through the system.

1.3.1 Parameter Definitions



The Parameters to be used throughout the system have to 
be configured by means of matching Parameter Definitions.

There are four kind of Parameters:

  Account Parameters: These are Parameters that are 
  related to Accounts. They model attributes, 
  characteristics or features related to Account 
  objects or customers. An example could be the contact 
  phone number for a customer.

  Product Parameters: These are Parameters that are 
  related to Products or Product Subscriptions. They 
  model attributes, characteristics and features 
  related to the Products that customers may subscribe 
  to, or related to the specific Product Subscriptions 
  they may have done to these Products. An example 
  could be the end date-time when a given subscription 
  has a minimum contract termIt would be the date-time to check against when 
unsubscribing a product that may impose penalties for 
being unsubscribed before six months elapse since its 
subscription, assigned at Product Subscription level. 
The actual period of six months could be another 
Product Parameter whose Value is assigned at Product 
level. The first Parameter Value would be calculated by 
using the second one by a Subscription Modifier 
Procedure at subscription time.
  .

  Service Parameters: These are Parameters that are 
  related to Services or Service Subscriptions. They 
  model attributes, characteristics and features 
  related to the Services that may be provided to 
  customers, or related to the specific Service 
  Subscriptions that the customers may have as their 
  rights to receive the Service. An example could be 
  the domain, like "mygreatmail.com", that is applied to 
  every e-mail Service that customers of a given e-mail 
  provider receive or subscribeThe Value would be assigned at Service level, and it 
would be inherited by every Service Subscription that 
users get via their Product Subscriptions to Products 
including the former Service.
  .

  Structure Type Parameters: These are special Parameters 
  used in order to define composite structure data 
  types as explained in section [sub:Structure-Types].

Apart from applying to different kinds of entities and 
being subject to the inheritance rules defined by those 
entities, the three kinds of Parameters are defined in 
the same way and may contain the same kinds of information.

A Parameter definition is done by specifying the 
following data:

* Parameter ID (auto-generated by the platformNote that Structure Parameters will use a number of 
different ID's for each one of its component 
sub-Parameters (fields).
  ), that is a numeric unique identifier for the 
  Parameter inside ORE.

* Parameter definition place, a pointer to the entity 
  on which the Parameter is definedThis could be a specific Service, a specific Product, a 
Structure Type, or the special case of Parameters 
defined for every Account.
  .

* Parameter name, a string with a unique, short name 
  used for Procedures and other program entities to 
  identify the Parameter.

* Parameter label, a text label to display in forms 
  where this parameter may be filled in or displayed.

* Parameter description, a text explaining the 
  Parameter purpose and usage, to be shown in tool-tips 
  and help dialogs.

* Parameter type, the kind of data that the Values for 
  this Parameter are. Supported Parameter types in ORE are:

  * String (strings of up to a given maximum numberThe maximum length of the String-type fields may be 
configured at database schema installation time, and is 
subject to the limits imposed by the specific database 
management system in use. PostgreSQL databases may be 
configured in order to impose no restriction (up to 2GB 
as of PostgreSQL 7.4) on the length of these Values.
      of Unicode characters).

  * Integer (64 bit values).

  * Double (floating point values).

  * Decimal (decimal, arbitrary precisionAs with the String type, the actual precision may be 
configured at database schema installation time, and is 
subject to the limits imposed by the specific database 
management system in use. PostgreSQL databases as of 
PostgreSQL version 7.4 may be configured in order to 
impose no restriction precision of these Values.
     real values).

  * Date-time (millisecond-level 64 bit precision UTC 
    timestamps).

  * Boolean (true or false).

  * ID (numeric identifier) types referring to either:

    * an Account ID.

    * a Catalog ID.

    * a Product ID.

    * a Product Subscription ID.

    * a Service ID.

    * a Service Subscription ID.

    * a Procedure ID.

  * List of <a given type> (arbitrary-length, 
    index-based ordered arrays of values of a given type).

  * Structure of <set of name,type tuples> (composite 
    type made of fields, each field with its own name 
    and type) as defined by a referenced Structure 
    Type. 

* Whether the Parameter is mandatory or not; entities 
  having a definition but no value for a mandatory 
  Parameter are not allowed.

* Whether Parameter Values should be unique; the same 
  Value for a unique Parameter may not be repeated.

* Whether the Parameter Values are historical; 
  Parameters marked as historical store their Values in 
  a special format that records how these Values change 
  along the time. This format consists of a succession 
  of time intervals with a specific Value assigned to 
  each one of these time intervals. This allows for 
  past Values to be recorded, as well as for future 
  Values to be scheduled.

ORE may pre-define some internal or general Parameters 
as needed for special purposes.

1.3.2 Parameter Values



Values store actual values for the Parameters defined 
throughout the system.

Each value stored in ORE consists of the following data:

* Parameter Value ID (auto-generated by the platformNote that Values for List or Structure Parameters will 
use a number of different ID's for each one of its 
component sub-Values.
  ), that is a numeric unique identifier for the 
  Parameter Value inside ORE.

* Parameter ID, the identifier of the Parameter 
  Definition which defines this kind of Values.

* Parent Parameter Value ID, the identifier of the 
  parent Parameter Value for list or structure Values elements.

* Parameter Value assignment place, a pointer to the 
  entity on which the Parameter has been assigned this ValueThis could be a specific Service or Service 
Subscription, a specific Product or Product 
subscription, a specific Account, or the special cases 
of Parameter Values pre-defined for every Account.
  .

* As alternatives, either of:

  * Actual valueFilled in directly for basic-type Parameters, filled in 
in sub-Values for complex (list or structure) Parameters.
    , that may be a value of the type of the Parameter, 
    or the special value delete, which means that any 
    inherited Value is discarded for this Parameter. 
    Parent entity Values are automatically inherited 
    when no Value is defined at a given entity level.

  * Reference to another Parameter Value of the same 
    type that is used as this Value had the same value, 
    by including the Parameter ID of the Value to reference.

The usage of reference values explained above allows, 
for instance, to use an Account-related Value for a 
Parameter in a Service Subscription. References are 
restricted to certain combinations that make sense, 
with the allowed combinations shown in table [cap:Allowed-Value-references.].

                                      |     Referenced Parameter type     |

<cap:Allowed-Value-references.>Allowed Value references.

Values for Parameters that are configured to have 
historical Values are stored in a time line like 
manner. That means that each Value is stored multiple 
times, once for each time its Value changes in a new, 
non-overlapping time segment. So, for Values that are 
historical, two more fields are stored along with each 
Value instance along time:

* Effective start date-time (millisecond-level 64 bit 
  precision UTC timestamps), the timestamp for the 
  instant (included in timestamp comparisons) in which 
  the associated Value instance takes effect, with a 
  minimum negative value that may be encoded meaning -\infty . 

* Effective end date-time (millisecond-level 64 bit 
  precision UTC timestamps), the timestamp for the 
  instant (excluded in timestamp comparisons) in which 
  the associated Value instance stops being in effect, 
  with a maximum positive value that may be encoded 
  meaning +\infty .

<cap:Time-lines-for-Values>Time lines for historical and non-historical Values.

For historical Values, these segment delimiters may be 
used as a part of the Parameter Value ID, and inherited 
by child Values for composite datatypes. For 
non-historical Values the same convention may be used 
by always using only one segment in the range \left[-\infty,+\infty\right). See 
figure [cap:Time-lines-for-Values] for an illustration.

1.3.3 <sub:Structure-Types>Structure Types



In order to use a given structure as the type of a 
Parameter or as the element type of a list Parameter, 
the structure to be used must be defined first.

For this purpose, ORE holds a repository of Structure 
Types. For each one of these the following information 
is stored:

* Structure Type ID (auto-generated by the platform), 
  that is a numeric unique identifier for the Structure 
  Type inside ORE.

* Structure Type name, a string with a unique, short 
  name used for Procedures and other program entities 
  to identify the Structure Type.

Fields for each Structure Type are defined as Parameter 
Definitions whose definition place points to the 
specific Structure Type.
